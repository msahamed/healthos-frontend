    q: "What is a voice biomarker?",
    a: "A voice biomarker is a measurable acoustic feature of how you sound — such as pitch, loudness, speaking rate, pauses, and vocal clarity — that correlates with a physiological or psychological state like stress, fatigue, or energy. It reflects how you say something, not what you say.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are voice biomarkers accurate?",
    a: "Individual acoustic markers are well-established in peer-reviewed speech science — for example, raised pitch and reduced vocal clarity under stress, or slower rate and more pausing under fatigue. Accuracy is strongest as a relative, within-person read against your own baseline rather than a clinical or cross-person diagnosis.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a voice biomarker app run without sending my audio to the cloud?",
    a: "Yes. HealthOS runs entirely on-device — the acoustic features are extracted on your phone and your voice audio never leaves it. Many clinical voice-biomarker systems are cloud-based; on-device analysis is what makes a private, consumer version possible.",

        <p className="lead">
          A voice biomarker is a measurable feature of how you sound — pitch,
          loudness, pace, pauses, vocal clarity — that reflects a physiological
          or psychological state such as stress, fatigue, or energy. It
          captures <strong>how</strong> you say something, not the words you
          say.
        </p>

        <h2>How voice biomarkers work</h2>
        <p>
          When your nervous system shifts, your voice shifts with it — usually
          before you consciously notice. Stress tends to raise pitch and reduce
          vocal clarity; fatigue tends to slow your rate, flatten your tone, and
          add pauses. These changes are subtle and hard to hear yourself, but
          they are measurable. A voice biomarker system extracts those acoustic
          features from a short speech sample and maps them to a state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crucially, the strongest reads are <strong>relative</strong>:
          comparing today&apos;s voice against your own recent baseline (&quot;higher
          or lower than your usual&quot;) is far more reliable than comparing you
          against the general population.
        </p>

        <h2>What HealthOS reads from your voice</h2>
        <p>
          HealthOS computes eight signals from a few seconds of unscripted
          speech: <strong>energy, stress, confidence, fatigue, vocal strain,
          expressiveness, articulation, and breathing</strong>. Each is a
          transparent, deterministic formula — a weighted blend of acoustic
          features compared against your roughly 30-day rolling baseline. It is
          not a black-box model guessing a number.
        </p>

        <h2>Is it grounded in real science?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes. The feature-to-state mappings come from decades of peer-reviewed
          speech research rather than being invented. HealthOS composes
          validated markers — for example, pitch and vocal-clarity changes under
          stress, and rate, tone, and pausing changes under fatigue. The honest
          limits matter too: phone-microphone noise means values are best read
          day-over-day within one person, not across different people, and the
          weights that combine markers are research-grounded priors still being
          calibrated against ground truth.
        </p>

        <h2>Why on-device matters</h2>
        <p>
          Most established voice-biomarker technology is clinical and
          cloud-based — your audio is uploaded for analysis. HealthOS runs
          entirely on-device: the features are extracted on your phone and your
          voice audio never leaves it. That privacy model is what makes a
          consumer voice-biomarker app possible in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>Voice biomarkers vs. wearables</h2>
        <p>
          Wearables like Oura and WHOOP measure physiology (heart rate, HRV,
          sleep) and infer stress from it. Voice biomarkers read psychological
          and nervous-system state — confidence, vocal strain, expressiveness —
          that a wrist sensor cannot detect. The two are complementary. We go
          deeper on this in our{" "}
