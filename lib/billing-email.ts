// Lifecycle email: trial, subscription, cancellation.
//
// ALL of it comes from us, not from Stripe. Stripe can send its own
// receipts, but a customer who gets some messages from Stripe and
// others from Ontor is being talked to by two different companies.
// One sender, one voice. Stripe keeps only the things it is genuinely
// better at — the invoice PDF and the failed-card retry sequence, both
// reachable from the billing portal.
//
// Sending is best-effort everywhere it is called. A webhook that threw
// because an email bounced would make Stripe retry a payment event
// that already succeeded, and the customer would be charged correctly
// but recorded as failing. Access is the important part; the email is
// a courtesy on top.
